# Netflix Clone - My first project

This is a Netflix clone landing page created for practice purposes. It is not an official Netflix product. The page is responsive and uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Please visit official Netflix website at [netflix.com](https://www.netflix.com/).

My `Netflix` version is just for styling practice and it is not a real website (not for any commercial purposes).
